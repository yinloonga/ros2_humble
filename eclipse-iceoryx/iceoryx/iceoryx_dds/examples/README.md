# DDS Gateway Examples

Here you can find examples how to use the dds gateway in a real system.
The examples use docker to simulate separated hosts running iceoryx.

## Running the Examples

Simply run the script: `run_example.sh`

You will be given an option to choose an example to run, after which the
necessary Docker containers will be built and run automatically.

## Setting up your own system

For help setting up your own iceoryx systems to use the DDS gateway,
refer to the entrypoint scripts used by the example docker containers.
